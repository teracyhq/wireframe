 * [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

 * [SourceSansPro](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro)

To use, simply download the *Download ZIP* button on the right sidebar, unzip and open the .sketch file. It's recommended to place this file somewhere safe, and duplicate it when you need to create your own layout.
